    ÔøΩ INTELLIGENCE MISSION PARAMETERS ÔøΩ
    Turn this person into a citizen journalist investigating their own neighborhood's shadow network.
    
    OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
    
    ÔøΩ FOLLOW THE MONEY:
    - Which corporations/developers REALLY control each area
    - What backroom deals shaped the neighborhood
    - How gentrification was engineered and by whom
    - Which "community improvements" were actually power grabs
    - What financial interests are behind major local businesses
    - How public space was privatized or monetized
    
    üîç DECODE THE CONTROL SYSTEMS:
    - Surveillance networks (cameras, sensors, tracking systems)
    - Architectural psychology (how spaces control behavior)
    - Information warfare (how narratives are shaped)
    - Economic manipulation (how money flows are controlled)
    - Social engineering (how communities are managed)
    
    üïµÔ∏è EXPOSE THE HIDDEN NETWORKS:
    - Secret societies and elite clubs operating locally
    - Underground economies (legal and illegal)
    - Information brokers and influence peddlers
    - Organized crime connections to legitimate businesses
    - Government/corporate partnerships and their real agendas
    - Academic/research institutions doing classified work
    
    üìä REVEAL THE SUPPRESSED HISTORIES:
    - What communities were destroyed for "development"
    - Which protests, strikes, or resistance movements were crushed
    - How local leaders were bought, blackmailed, or eliminated
    - What environmental crimes were covered up
    - Which cultural/artistic movements were co-opted or destroyed
    
    üéØ ADVENTURE INTELLIGENCE PROFILE:
    - Like a Netflix conspiracy documentary but you're the investigator
    - Every location is a piece of evidence in a larger puzzle
    - Connect local dots to national/international power structures
    - Show how ordinary people are surveilled, controlled, and manipulated
    - Expose the mechanisms that keep people distracted and compliant
    
    üñºÔ∏è VISUAL INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENT:
    Create an image prompt that would generate a scene like a still frame from a gritty investigative documentary. Think: shadowy urban landscapes, mysterious figures, hidden camera angles, architectural secrets, coded messages, underground passages, or surveillance equipment. The image should make viewers feel like they're about to uncover a major conspiracy or witness something they weren't supposed to see.
    
    ÔøΩ DEEP STATE LOCAL EXAMPLES:
    - "This Starbucks location was chosen because it's the perfect surveillance hub for monitoring [target group]"
    - "The 'random' placement of these benches creates a dead zone that prevents [type of gathering]"
    - "This building's architecture incorporates [hidden technology] for [covert purpose]"
    - "The timing of this construction project perfectly coincided with [political event] - not a coincidence"
    - "This 'community center' is actually a front for [intelligence operation]"
    - "The reason they closed [previous business] was to install [surveillance/control system]"
    
    Make them feel like Neo seeing the Matrix for the first time. Every mundane detail should reveal layers of control, manipulation, and hidden agendas.
